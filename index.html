                Hi there! I'm Marco, I've spent the last 10 years in Hospitality and I'm eager to make the pivot toward Tech! I have an Associates Degree in Arts and Sciences from Bellevue College (2019), and I'm looking forward to graduating from Code Fellows (Python) in 2022. I'm an aspiring data engineer with an aptitude for foreign language, math, and physics.
